This Scenario will walk the user through seting up Argo on a kubernetes instance and will demonstrate a simple batch job using Argo.

These exercises have been tests in the single node Kubernetes cluster that is set up for you here in Katacoda, but you should also be able to run the same exercises using the Kubernetes support in Docker for Mac/Windows on your laptop if you prefer.
