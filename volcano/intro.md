Volcano is system for runnning high performance workloads on Kubernetes. It provides a suite of mechanisms currently missing from Kubernetes that are commonly required by many classes of high performance workload including:

* Machine Learning/Deep Learning,
* Bioinformatics/Genomics, and
* Other “big data” applications.

These types of applications typically run on generalized domain frameworks like Tensorflow, Spark, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with.
